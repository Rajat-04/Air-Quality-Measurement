# This project in this repo is currently on development.

** In this project we are trying to build an portable Air quality sensor. Which can measure various gases concentration level in the atmosphere near it. Whenever the concentration of a gas increases beyond a threshold value an alert would be sent to the user. **

# Software Used:
Arduino IDE
Visual studio code

# Hardware Used:
Arduino UNO Board
Gas sensor (MQ-7, MQ-135, MQ-4, MQ-6)
Temperature and Humidity sensor (DHT-11)
